or dr angela chu video 
using npm install we can install all the dependencies present in package.json

step1:
change the PORT because it is actually use the environment port of heroku
and not set default one like i have
let port = process.env.PORT;
if (port == null || port == "") {
  port = 3000;
}
step 2:
create a Procfile
and this file will basically
tell
heroku which file to run justlike we have in package.json we have start app.js file which is running when we start our server so we want to tell heraku which file to run exactly the same way 
web : node app.js

step 3:
create an application on heroku dashboard now at the deployement you will see deployement step

step 4:
Make sure you have heroku cli installed

step 5:
heroku login

step 6:
create a new GIT repository
initialize git repo
git init
heroku git: remote -a appName
 
step7:
deploy your application
commit your code to repo and deploy it to heroku using git
git  add .
git commit -m "message"
git push heroku master
now it will give us an url or we simply go to dashboard and open app

Error faced during process
Issue
You are opening your application and an "Application Error" message is displayed.
